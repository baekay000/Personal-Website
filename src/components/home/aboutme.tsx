        About
        <div className="text-sm mr-3 my-6">
          Hello, I am a second-year undergraduate student studying computer
          science at the University of Tennessee. As an Dean's List student in
          two distinct honors programs (Cook Grand Challenge and Heath
          Integrated Business and Engineering), I am an achiever. I love pushing
          myself to improve, whether that be in academics or extracurriculars. I
          learn fast and well, as evidenced from the diversity of my internship
          experience at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. I also love solving
          problems, whether that be working through conflict in a group or
          creating solutions using code that save time, energy, and money. Most
          of all, I love people. I am an aspiring software engineering that is
          passionate about creating meaningful products, especially in the
          medical field. Having volunteered at Williamson Medical Center and
          East Tennessee Children's Hospital, I have seen first-hand how
          valuable health is. I want to create products that truly create this
          value for those that use them. After furthering my education, I look
          forward to working on these valuable products with diverse
          individuals, whose unique experiences will allow for the creation of
          more innovative solutions. During my time at college, I hope to
          explore different fields of computer science and expose myself to
          various ideas and innovations.
